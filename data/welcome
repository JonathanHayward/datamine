<p>What is a <em>data mine</em>?</p>

<p><em>Data mining</em> is a branch of artificial intelligence which tries to
sift through mounds of data to discover hidden patterns and insights.</p>

<p>These pages have less to do with artificial intelligence than
<em>human-computer intelligent interaction</em>. Human-computer intelligent
interaction is a different field which is about helping computers help you
think. The focus is not on the computer's intelligence, but the
<em>person's</em>. This particular tool is meant to help you sift through
mounds of data and discover hidden patterns and insights.</p>

<p>This search engine was written by Jonathan Hayward as a tool to study the
Nicaene and Post-Nicaene Fathers collection for his studies. He has
studied French at the Sorbonne, math at the University of Illinois, and
theology at Cambridge. He enjoys writing, musing, and talking with his
friends. Jonathan has taught at DeVry University and is available for work.</p>
